This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
source("../Rprofile.R", echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}
source("../01 Data/titanic_data.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/graph1.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/graph2.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/graph3.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/graph4.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/graph5.R", echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
source("../02 Visualizations/graph6.R", echo = TRUE)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
